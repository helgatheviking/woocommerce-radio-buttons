== Frequently asked questions ==
= How to display 'add to cart' and selected variation automatically =
Open your WP Dashboard and click on products, then click on one of your variation products and scroll down to product data.  Under the tab 'variations' select a default variation (towards the bottom) and click update :).

= I have downloaded your plugin and activated but I still do not get any radio buttons =
This is typically caused by a theme or plugin conflicting.  Try activating the default twenty-twentyfour wordpress theme.  If that doesnt work then go through and deactivate your plugins and then reactivate one at a time to find the conflict.
